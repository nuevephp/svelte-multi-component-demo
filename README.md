# svelte multi component demo

In this project we compile components to use outside of the Svelte framework into a regular webpage.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/silentworks/svelte-multi-component-demo.git
cd svelte-multi-component-demo
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-multi-component-demo
npm install
```

...then build with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run build
```

and now run the server to serve the `public` directory

```bash
npm start
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running.
